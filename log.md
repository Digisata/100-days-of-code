# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created my very first Go library.

**Thoughts:** Learn how to write better README.md and still wonder what is the purpose to mix them with HTML sometimes? And I also learn how to tag properly with git.

### Day 1: February 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added some tools and unit test.

**Thoughts:** learn a bit about the unit tests in go and create a new branch before its release with a new tag.
