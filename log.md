# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created my very first Go library.

**Thoughts:** Learn how to write better README.md and still wonder what is the purpose to mix them with HTML sometimes? And I also learn how to tag properly with git.

### Day 1: February 5, 2023

### Day 3: February 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Created API spec documentation using swagger and shipped it with docker.

**Thoughts:** At first, I was struggling with [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger) library to create the API documentation, so I decided to change it with [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo) and [swaggo](https://github.com/swaggo/swag).
